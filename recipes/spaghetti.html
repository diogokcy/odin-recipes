    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        🍅 <strong>Use whole peeled tomatoes</strong> and crush them by hand for
        a chunkier, rustic sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        🧄 <strong>Don’t burn the garlic!</strong> It only needs about 30–60
        seconds to become fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        🌱 <strong>Add fresh herbs</strong> like oregano, thyme, or parsley to
        enhance the flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        🍝 <strong>Reserve a little pasta water</strong> (1/4 cup) to mix into
        the sauce if it’s too thick — the starch helps bind the sauce to the
        pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        🧀 <strong>For extra richness,</strong> stir in a tablespoon of butter
        right before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        🌶️ <strong>Want some heat?</strong> Add a pinch of red pepper flakes
        when cooking the garlic.
      </li>
    </ul>
